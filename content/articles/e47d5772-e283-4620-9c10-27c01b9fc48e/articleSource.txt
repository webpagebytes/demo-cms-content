	 Webpagebytes CMS uses server side plugins (named Controllers in MVC pattern) to provide the data displayed in the generated content and to add custom server side functionality to various requests.

	 On this page, the account statement is generated for the web page, for an email and in a pdf file. All three versions display the same data and share the same controller that provides the account statement data. 
</p>

<p>
	 A controller can also fetch content from CMS to generate another content. The email is sent from a controller that fetches the email body and the subject from the  CMS engine. The pdf file is generated from a controller that fetches XSL-FO content from the CMS engine and then converts it to PDF using Apache FOP.

	 The principle is to write a controller once and then reuse it to generate various contents, web pages, images, emails, pdf files and so on.
